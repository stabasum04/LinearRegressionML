# LinearRegressionML
This project has the process of building a Linear Regression model from scratch using Python. Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most commonly used Machine Learning algorithms for predicting continuous values.


Contents:

1. Data Collection
   - Load the dataset using `pandas` to get started with the analysis.

2. Data Preparation
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values using methods like `fillna()` or `dropna()`.

3. Data Exploration
   - Import necessary libraries such as `scikit-learn`.
   - Split the data into feature matrix (`X`) and target vector (`Y`).
   - Further divide the data into training and testing sets (e.g., an 80-20 split).

4. Model Implementation
   - Apply Linear Regression using `linear_model.LinearRegression()` from `scikit-learn`.
   - Train the model with the training data and make predictions.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²).

5. Visualization:
   - Plot the Actual vs. Predicted values using a scatter plot to visualize model accuracy.

Getting Started:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   >>[git clone https://github.com/stabasum04/ML-Linear-Regression-Model.git]
   >>cd ML-Linear-Regression-Model
 

2. Install the necessary packages:
   Ensure you have the following Python packages installed: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `seaborn`.

   
   >>pip3 install pandas scikit-learn seaborn(the pip command for each python version changes, this may or may not work for you)
   

3. Run the script:
   Execute the `bostonhousing.py` script to see the model in action.

   >> python3 bostonhousing.py
